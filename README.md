# Multimedia-Systems-Design
This is the assignment and project files for USC-2️⃣2️⃣Fall-CSCI5⃣️7⃣️6⃣️ Multimedia Systems Design


-  Quantization, Subsampling and Scaling w/wo Antialiasing [HW1]
   -  analyzing how it affects visual media types like images and video
   -  RGB -> YUV -> GRB
     
-  Image Segmentation w/wo green screen [HW2]
   -  analyzing color channels especially as it pertains to image segmentation. (image processing and computer vision)
   -  display a sequence of images at the frame rate of display and implement the color algorithms needed in videos.
   -  the process has been made simpler via the use of **green screen and chroma keying techniques**.
 
-  DWT Compression (image compression using wavelets) [HW3]
   -  read an RGB file and convert the image pixel to a DWT representation (as used in the JPEG2000 implementation) for each channel
 



-  panorama generation from video [Final Project]
   -  block-based motion compensation
   -  background/foreground detection
   -  graphics transformations
   -  creating panoramas by image stitching
   
   -  At the heart of it is to
      -  detect **foreground/background regions and objects per frame**
      -  **create intermediary data structures** (like a panorama) which can then be used to
      -  **create novel video applications**.
